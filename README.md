# Multiple Regression Model Analysis using Bank Marketing Data

In this project, we will build a multiple regression model using the [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) Data Set obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We will use the `bank-full.csv` dataset for our analysis. The aim is to predict a customer's response to a marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese banking institution.
